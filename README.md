Hi, I’m Arczi.

Currently I'm Junior Python Developer.
Earlier, I'm working as a SysOp for last 14 years: Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, networks, VMware etc.

I’m interested in:  
- aviation (virtual pilot on Boeing 737NG with home cockpit),  
- astronomy and astrophotography (Sky-Watcher Maksutov-Cassegrain 127/1500 telescope with ZWO ASI 462MC planetary camera),  
- space exploration and astronautics (listen International Space Station with RTL-SDR),  
- motorcycle trips around Europe.
   
I’m currently learning Python.
