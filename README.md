Hi, I’m Arek.

Currently I'm Junior Python Developer.

Earlier, I'm working as a SysOps for last 14 years: Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, networks, VMware etc.

I’m interested in:  
- aviation (virtual pilot on Boeing 737NG with home cockpit),  
- astronomy and astrophotography (planetary imaging with my telescopes),  
- space exploration and astronautics (e.g. listen International Space Station with RTL-SDR),  
- motorcycle trips around Europe.
